Extensions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

JIM-POSIX

This is the start of a library that should export to Jim useful bits of the
POSIX API. For now there are just a few utility functions, but it's
an example on how to write a simple library for Jim.

JIM-WIN32

This is the start of a library that should export to Jim useful bits of the
WIN32 API. Currently there is just one function that is used to call windows
applications. For example run jim and try the extension with:

  load jim-win32.dll
  win32.shellexecute open notepad

You should see a notepad application running.

- First of all, thanks to every guy that's listed in the AUTHORS file,
  that directly helped with code and ideas.
- Many people on the Tclers Chat that helped me to explore issues
  about the use and the implementation of the Tcl programming language.
- David Welton for the tech info sharing and our chats about
  programming languages design and the ability of software to scale down.
- The autors of "valgrind", for this wonderful tool, that helped me a
  lot to fix bugs in minutes instead of hours.
