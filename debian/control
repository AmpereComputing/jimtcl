Description: Jim is an opensource small-footprint implementation of Tcl.
 Jim is an opensource small-footprint implementation of the Tcl programming 
 language. It implements a large subset of Tcl and adds new features like 
 references with garbage collection, closures, built-in Object Oriented 
 Programming system, Functional Programming commands, first-class arrays and
 UTF-8 support. All this with a binary size of about 100-200kB (depending upon 
 selected options).
