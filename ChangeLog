	* ChangeLog, jim.c, jim.h, jimsh.c: Did some fix in jimsh.c,
	  exported some more API function to set variables and global
	  variables using a string C as name instead of a Jim_Obj. This is

2005-03-08 16:10  patthoyts

	* bench.tcl, jim.c, jim.h: JIM_VERSION is to be an integer value
	  which we present as MAJOR.MINOR to users. MAJOR is JIM_VERSION /

	  tables elements).

2005-03-07 18:58  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim.c: Added "increasing", "decreasing", "ascii",
	  "nocase" options to lsort (SS). The plan is to don't add more

2005-03-07 09:23  antirez

	* ChangeLog, TODO: TODO changes

2005-03-06 23:42  antirez

	* bench.tcl, jim.c, regtest.tcl, test.tcl: A specializing version
	  of [for] that appears able to match the performaces of Tcl8.4 for
	  the specialized forms. The implementation is a bit complex so may

	  [continue] was fixed and the regression test added.

2005-03-06 11:43  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim.c, jim.h, doc/AIO-Extension.txt: Fixed a race

	* ChangeLog, Makefile, TODO, jim-aio.c, jim.c, jim.h: Added
	  Jim_GetEnum() API function. StringCoreCommand and AIO extension
	  modified to use this API. There are plenty of other places where
	  this will work better than the raw CompareStringImmediate().
	  Original idea from Tcl, Original implementation from Pat Thoyts,
	  I changed the implementationto use CSI and for automatic error
	  generation with all the valid options listed.

2005-03-05 23:06  patthoyts

	  packages to register a data structure with a Jim interpreter.

2005-03-05 10:46  antirez

	* ChangeLog, jim.c, jim.h: removed strcasecmp() and isascii(). Now
	  the Jim core is fully ANSI-C excluding the [load] command. I plan

	  compilation.

2005-03-05 10:34  antirez

	* AUTHORS, ChangeLog, README, jim.c, jim.h, test.tcl: [switch]

2005-03-03 14:10  antirez

	* Makefile, jim-posix.c, jim-win32.c, jim-win32com.c, jim.c, jim.h:
	  shell and library splitted. Now jim.c contains only the language
	  implementation, while the shell is into jimsh.c, that is actually

	  Important changes in jim.h to make Jim play well with
	  extensions/embedders at the same time, and to deal with multiple

2005-03-02 14:31  antirez

	* jim.c, jim.h: JIM_LL_MODIFIER is now called JIM_WIDE_MODIFIER so
	  that's set simply to "ld" if the system isn't 64bit capable. This
	  allows to remove few ifdefs from jim.c.

2005-03-02 13:36  antirez

	* STYLE, bench.tcl, jim.c: non local literal sharing disabled.
	  bench.tcl modified to be more verbose.

	  about exported symbols restriction.

2005-02-28 20:29  antirez

	* jim.c, test.tcl: Foreach command! Thanks to Clemens.	Also a
	  patch about empty string and StringAppendString causing memory
	  corruption, and a patch about Jim_WrongNumArgs that I modified
	  because caused other tests to fail.
