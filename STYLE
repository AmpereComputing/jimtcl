-----------
INDENTATION
-----------

Indentation is 4 spaces, no smart-tabs are used (i.e.
two indentation steps of 4 spaces will not be converted
into a real tab, but 8 spaces).

---------------
FUNCTIONS NAMES
---------------

Functions names of exported functions are in the form:

Jim_ExportedFunctionName()

The prefix is "Jim_", every word composing the function name
is capitalized.

Not exported functions that are of general interest for the Jim
core, like JimFreeInterp() are capitalized the same way, but the
prefix used for this functions is "Jim" instead of "Jim_".
Another example is:

JimNotExportedFunction()

Not exported functions that are not general, like functions
implementing hashtables or jim objects methods can be named
in any prefix as long as capitalization rules are followed,
like in:

ListSetIndex()

---------------
VARIABLES NAMES
---------------

Global variables follow the same names convention of functions.

Local variables have usually short names. A counter is just 'i', or 'j',
or something like this. When a longer name is required, composed of
more words, capitalization is used, but the first word starts in
lowcase:

thisIsALogVarName

----------
C FEATURES
----------

Only C89 ANSI C is allowed. C99 features can't be used currently.
