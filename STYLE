-----------
INDENTATION
-----------

indentation is 4 spaces, no smart-tabs are used (i.e.
two indentation steps of 4 spaces will not be converted
into a real tab, but 8 spaces).

---------------
FUNCTIONS NAMES
---------------

Functions names of exported functions are in the form:

Jim_ExportedFunctionName()

The prefix is "Jim_", every word composing the function name
is capitalized.

Non exported functions are also capitalized, but in such
a case the prefix is just "Jim", like in

JimNotExportedFunction()

---------------
VARIABLES NAMES
---------------

Global variables follow the same names convention of functions.

Local variables have usually short names. A counter is just 'i', or 'j',
or something like this. When a longer name is required, composed of
more words, capitalization is used, but the first word starts in
lowcase:

thisIsALogVarName

----------
C FEATURES
----------

Only C89 ANSI C is allowed. C99 features can't be used currently.
